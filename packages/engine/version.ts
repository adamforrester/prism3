/**
 * Prism3 engine — VERSIONING (the constants + the pure classifier).
 *
 * Deliberately a LEAF module: it imports nothing from the engine, so `tree.ts` can stamp
 * `ENGINE_VERSION` into every emitted artifact while `token-contract.ts` imports both this and
 * the whole engine, with no cycle. Everything here is pure — the corpus build and the CLI live
 * next door in `token-contract.ts`.
 *
 * TWO versions, deliberately independent, because they answer different questions:
 *
 *  - `ENGINE_VERSION`  — "what code produced this?" Stamped into every emitted tree and reported
 *                        as the MCP `serverInfo.version`. Bumps on any behaviour change, including
 *                        a pure VALUE change.
 *  - `CONTRACT_VERSION`— "can my app still resolve the names it references?" Bumps ONLY when the
 *                        guaranteed token-name surface changes.
 *
 * The split is the useful part. A consumer app writes `prism.color.text.primary` in its CSS; it
 * does not care that the brand's primary hue moved 4 degrees — that is the engine doing its job.
 * It cares enormously if `text.primary` stops existing, because the reference silently resolves to
 * nothing. So VALUES are not versioned and NAMES are. Tying them together would either cry wolf on
 * every brand tweak or stay silent through a rename; separating them lets each be strict.
 */

/**
 * The code. Bumps on any behaviour change — including one that only moves values.
 *
 * 0.3.1: semantic ink (`text|icon.<sem>`) now gates against its own `-subtle` tint as well as the page
 * floor, so it resolves a rung darker on white-page brands. Values only — no name moved, so
 * CONTRACT_VERSION stands. Exactly the case this split exists for.
 *
 * 0.3.2: muted semantic ink (`text|icon.<sem>-subtle`) is GATED at the large-text bar (`tertiaryMin`)
 * instead of shipping ungated at a fixed rung. Standard light/dark values are unchanged — every brand
 * already cleared 3:1 — so the only value move is HC, where the fixed rung could not respond to the
 * raised bar and now escalates a rung. A `min` going 0 → 3 is not a NAME change, so CONTRACT_VERSION
 * again stands; note that the contract covers path + `$type`, not the contrast metadata. (#570)
 *
 * 0.3.3: `border.focus-inverse` is emitted — a focus ring gated at `nonTextMin` against
 * `background.inverse.primary`. The single `border.focus` was gated on the page and reused on inverse
 * surfaces, where it measured 2.09:1 (hc-light) / 2.40:1 (hc-dark), below SC 1.4.11 in the two modes
 * that exist for users who most depend on seeing focus. No existing value moves — this ADDS a path,
 * which is why `CONTRACT_VERSION` moves too (a MINOR, unlike 0.3.1/0.3.2 above). (#573)
 *
 * 0.3.4: `WEIGHT_STYLE_NAME_MONO` (a hardcoded 600→Medium collapse for mono faces) is removed from
 * `emit-figma-font.ts`. It was a guess working around a spelling-variance bug (`Semi Bold` vs
 * `SemiBold`) that #499/#530 already fixed properly — the plugin write lane now resolves the emitted
 * style name against the family's REAL loaded styles at write time, so a mono family carrying 600
 * under any spelling now resolves it correctly instead of having it suppressed. `fontStyleName`'s
 * `mono` and non-`mono` tables now agree at every weight; no corpus brand's default configuration
 * exercises a mono face at weight 600 (`code` only ever takes the `default` role), so this bumps the
 * version for the behavior change without moving any committed corpus artifact. Values only — no
 * token name moved, so `CONTRACT_VERSION` stands. (#538)
 *
 * 0.4.0: the engine emits a second, CONFORMING projection of every tree — `<brand>.base.tokens.json`
 * plus one `<brand>.<mode>.overlay.tokens.json` per theme mode. The canonical tree is unchanged and
 * remains the source of truth; per-mode values still live under `$extensions.prism3.modes`, which
 * DTCG defines as ignorable, so the projection is what a stock consumer can actually read. A minor
 * rather than a patch because the artifact SET grew, not because anything existing moved — no token
 * name and no canonical value changed, so `CONTRACT_VERSION` stands. (#609)
 *
 * 0.5.0: the interactive outline EDGE is stateful — `interactive.<c>.border` (one value anchored at
 * palette step 500) becomes `interactive.<c>.border.{rest,hover,pressed}`, and the same for
 * `on-inverse.border`. Values move as well as names: the chromatic columns now FOLLOW THEIR INK,
 * which lands on a different ramp step than the old anchor in 34 of 40 corpus brand×mode×column
 * combinations — 17 of 20 for `primary` alone, and in every dark, hc-light and hc-dark mode. (The old
 * anchor was step 500 escalated by `chromatic()` only as far as `nonTextMin` demanded, so it already
 * sat off 500 in 2 of those 40; the count above is measured old-vs-new, not "differs from 500".)
 * Both versions move — this is the rare change that is simultaneously a behaviour change and a name
 * change, so it is worth stating that they moved for different reasons rather than as one event.
 * (#576)

/**
 * The guaranteed token-NAME surface. Starts at 1.0 while the engine is still 0.x, and that
 * inversion is intentional rather than a typo: the code is young, the names are settled. The
 * surface is 485 paths that every brand in the corpus emits — spanning both input dialects, a
 * hand-built legacy system (NB) and the sparsest input the engine accepts — with zero `$type`
 * disagreements between them. That is a thing worth promising, so it is promised at 1.x. (The
 * count moves with every bump below — 477 at 1.0.0 — so read it as "as of the latest entry".)
 *
 * 1.1.0: `on-inverse.border` (primary/neutral/destructive) landed in a PR that merged while this
 * one was in flight, adding 3 guaranteed paths — a MINOR bump, no removal or retype. (477 → 480)
 *
 * 1.2.0: the easing-role tier (`motion.easing-role.{default,enter,exit,emphasized}`) — a mode can
 * now re-point a ROLE to another curve instead of tuning a bezier per mode (#522/#527). 4 additive
 * paths, no removal or retype, so MINOR. (480 → 484)
 *
 * 2.0.0: the easing CURVE tier renamed to match what it names — a curve is a SHAPE, not a USE, and
 * the new role tier above left `motion.easing.{enter,exit,emphasized}` wearing names that belonged
 * to roles, not curves. Renamed to `motion.easing.{decelerate,accelerate,expressive}` (#531). 3
 * paths removed, 3 added — MAJOR, since a consumer resolving the old names gets nothing. The
 * removals are recorded in `DEPRECATIONS` below, each pointing at its replacement. (484 → 484)
 *
 * 2.1.0: `color.border.focus-inverse` — 1 added guaranteed path, no removal or retype, so MINOR.
 * Named as a flat suffix rather than nested under either existing leaf on purpose: both
 * `border.focus.inverse` and `border.inverse.focus` would turn a path consumers already reference
 * into a GROUP, which is a MAJOR break to add a token nobody asked to pay for. (#573) (484 → 485)
 *
 * 3.0.0: the interactive outline edge becomes stateful — the 6 bare `interactive.<c>.border` /
 * `interactive.<c>.on-inverse.border` leaves are REPLACED by `border.{rest,hover,pressed}` under
 * each. 6 removed, 18 added, so MAJOR; the removals are in `DEPRECATIONS` pointing at `border.rest`.
 * (#576) (485 → 497)
 *
 * This deliberately takes the opposite decision to 2.1.0 above, and the difference is the point.
 * 2.1.0 refused to turn an existing leaf into a group and paid a naming asymmetry
 * (`border.focus-inverse`) to keep a MINOR. Here the leaf becomes a group anyway, because the reason
 * to avoid it was the cost to consumers and the project is pre-alpha with none: the flat-suffix
 * dodge buys nothing and would leave `border-hover` permanently out of step with the
 * `{rest,hover,pressed}` shape that `fill.*` and `text.*` already use. Choose the right shape when
 * the break is free; pay for compatibility when someone is actually holding the other end.
 *
 * The alias that would have made this a MINOR is not merely undesirable, it is unrepresentable: a
 * node cannot be both a token (`$value`) and a group. Probed against stock Style Dictionary, a
 * `border` leaf carrying `rest`/`hover`/`pressed` children emits ONLY the leaf and drops all three
 * children silently — so the states would be invisible to exactly the conforming consumers #631's
 * gate exists to protect. A plausible-looking result rather than an error, which is the #575 shape.
