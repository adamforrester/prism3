/**
 * Prism3 engine — VERSIONING (the constants + the pure classifier).
 *
 * Deliberately a LEAF module: it imports nothing from the engine, so `tree.ts` can stamp
 * `ENGINE_VERSION` into every emitted artifact while `token-contract.ts` imports both this and
 * the whole engine, with no cycle. Everything here is pure — the corpus build and the CLI live
 * next door in `token-contract.ts`.
 *
 * TWO versions, deliberately independent, because they answer different questions:
 *
 *  - `ENGINE_VERSION`  — "what code produced this?" Stamped into every emitted tree and reported
 *                        as the MCP `serverInfo.version`. Bumps on any behaviour change, including
 *                        a pure VALUE change.
 *  - `CONTRACT_VERSION`— "can my app still resolve the names it references?" Bumps ONLY when the
 *                        guaranteed token-name surface changes.
 *
 * The split is the useful part. A consumer app writes `prism.color.text.primary` in its CSS; it
 * does not care that the brand's primary hue moved 4 degrees — that is the engine doing its job.
 * It cares enormously if `text.primary` stops existing, because the reference silently resolves to
 * nothing. So VALUES are not versioned and NAMES are. Tying them together would either cry wolf on
 * every brand tweak or stay silent through a rename; separating them lets each be strict.
 */

/**
 * The code. Bumps on any behaviour change — including one that only moves values.
 *
 * 0.3.1: semantic ink (`text|icon.<sem>`) now gates against its own `-subtle` tint as well as the page
 * floor, so it resolves a rung darker on white-page brands. Values only — no name moved, so
 * CONTRACT_VERSION stands. Exactly the case this split exists for.
 *
 * 0.3.2: muted semantic ink (`text|icon.<sem>-subtle`) is GATED at the large-text bar (`tertiaryMin`)
 * instead of shipping ungated at a fixed rung. Standard light/dark values are unchanged — every brand
 * already cleared 3:1 — so the only value move is HC, where the fixed rung could not respond to the
 * raised bar and now escalates a rung. A `min` going 0 → 3 is not a NAME change, so CONTRACT_VERSION
 * again stands; note that the contract covers path + `$type`, not the contrast metadata. (#570)

 * hand-built legacy system (NB) and the sparsest input the engine accepts — with zero `$type`
 * disagreements between them. That is a thing worth promising, so it is promised at 1.x.
