# 32 — Component build learnings (the skill backlog)

> Building Button revealed that the *repeatable* part of component work is not the component — it

## Why this file, and what belongs in it

We will do this catalogue-wide. The KB gave us a schema and a component API (`components/*.md`
§15); #111 built the def tier; #487 found that tier still could not reach Figma. Every one of those
steps produced knowledge that was not in the previous step's plan, and none of it was written
anywhere a future agent would find it.

An entry belongs here when it is **transferable to the next component**. A Button-specific token
binding does not. "The def can bind tokens it has no API to trigger, and nothing checks that" does.

Three kinds of entry, tagged so they can be triaged:

- **`[SKILL]`** — a check or a step a build-a-component skill should perform.
- **`[GATE]`** — something that should fail a build rather than rely on someone remembering.
- **`[KB]`** — a finding worth contributing *back* to the knowledge base, because the KB's research
  did not consider it (see the standing note below).

### The KB's standing remit, and where we deviate

The knowledge base is field research across best-in-class systems. It was not built to serve Prism3,
and in particular **it does not weigh Figma's constraints** — it looks at how components are
modelled, not at what a variant axis costs when Figma has no context mechanism. So: reference it
first, follow it where it holds, and challenge it where Prism3 has a constraint the research did not
face. When we do deviate, that deviation is itself a finding — tag it `[KB]` and feed it back.

## 2026-08-04 — from #487 / #488 (Button → Figma, step 1)

### `[GATE]` A shipped skill can be silently invalidated by an engine change

`Prism3/skills/prism3-theme/SKILL.md:82` teaches an agent to "map adjectives → levers — this is the
judgment the brief pays for". #477 replaced that judgment with a controlled vocabulary the engine
resolves *and logs*. An agent following the shipped skill today hand-picks numbers instead of passing
`personality`, losing precisely the audit trail #471 existed to create. Line 61 has the same drift:
`radiusScale` is documented as number-only, and now takes named stops.

**Nothing caught this.** The skills are shipped surfaces with no gate — unlike `out/**`, the schema
contracts and `web/dist`, all of which the US-English gate scans. A skill that describes a stale API
is worse than no skill, because an agent trusts it. This is the same shape as #281 (no gate reads the
committed artifact), one tier out.

### `[SKILL]` A def can bind tokens it has no API to trigger

Button binds three `on-inverse.label` token slots and has **no** `inverse` prop. It can paint an
inverse button and has no way to ask for one. That inconsistency is why #487 §3's `on-inverse`
question could not be answered from the def — the def genuinely does not say.

Check both directions: every bound token family should be reachable from *some* prop, variant or
state, and every prop that implies paint should have bindings. Neither direction is checked today.

### `[SKILL]` Validate the spec against the def before building from it

#487 was written to be picked up cold. Two of its statements did not survive contact:

- §0.1 lists six state values; §0.4 forbids codifying the legacy sheet's names; the def declares
  **seven**. The six *were* the legacy names. Following §0.1 would have shipped `active`/`focused`/
  `loading` and silently dropped `inactive` — and moved the headline count from the correct 756 to
  648.
- §4 says `width` "should not be a variant" without noting it *already is one* in `variants`, so the
  action is to move it to `codeOnly`, not to leave it alone. And the slot axis §4 assumes does not
  exist — there is `modifiers`, a differently-shaped axis whose `pending` duplicates a state.

Neither was carelessness; both are what happens when a spec is written from a legacy artifact and the
def has moved. **Read the def first, then the spec, and reconcile explicitly.**

### `[GATE]` An axis Figma will not carry must be admitted, not merely absent

`anatomy.codeOnly` already existed as the place a def admits what the Figma leg drops, and it is
validated non-empty. #488 made the pairing mandatory: a `variants` axis missing from
`figmaProperties.variantAxes` with no `codeOnly` mention is an **error**. It did real work on first
use — it forced Button's two omissions to be written down with reasons instead of quietly vanishing.

Generalize: wherever a projection is allowed to be partial, the omission needs a named home, or
"partial" decays into "incomplete and nobody noticed".

### `[SKILL]` Check the token tier exists before declaring an axis

#487 §3 proposed an `accent` intent. `grep accent` across the emitted Figma variable names → **0
hits**. The axis was declared in prose and had nothing to bind. Same class: `filled elevated` needs
an elevation binding, and elevation is an *effect style*, not a variable — a different API
(`effectStyleId` vs `setBoundVariable`) that would fail at paste time if squeezed into `bound`.

**Before adding a variant value, resolve it against the emitted names.** A stubbed axis is worse than
a smaller correct set.

### `[SKILL]` Figma property kinds are not interchangeable, and only one carries layout

A Figma BOOLEAN drives one node's `visible` and nothing else. It cannot change an ancestor's
`paddingLeft` — which is exactly what #326's split inline padding needs. So **slot presence must be a
variant axis** while slot *content* is an INSTANCE_SWAP. Any property that implies a layout
consequence has to be a variant; nothing else can express one.

This is the general trap: the dev API shape (a `leadingVisual` prop) and the Figma shape (a variant
axis) diverge for a mechanical reason, and the divergence must be recorded rather than papered over.

### `[SKILL]` State the variant count before building, and re-state it when an axis moves

`3 × 3 × 3 × 7 = 189` today; `× 4` slots = **756**. Payload is ~866 bytes per variant against a 45KB
paste ceiling, so chunking is mandatory rather than an optimization. A test asserts the 189 so that
any axis change has to move a number a reviewer can see.

### `[SKILL]` A test suite that dies on the first defect reports zero, not one

Twice now, in suites written after the lesson. An invalid enum in a traits table threw deep inside
`componentSizes` and took a 1,409-assertion run with it — the static check had already recorded the
real cause, but the report never printed. Fail soft: record the throw, return a sentinel that cannot
compare equal to anything, keep going.

### `[KB]` Where does "inverse / on-color" live — the component or the container?

Unresolved, and the most interesting open question of the batch. Our own research (`docs/20 §9`)
reframed inverse as a **surface context**, explicitly to escape Prism2's hand-mirroring (60 of 122
action tokens). The field is split: Material 3 and Carbon apply it contextually; Adobe Spectrum makes
it a Button prop (`staticColor`) — because context cannot be computed when the ground is a
photograph, which is a case the contextual model genuinely cannot serve.

The consumer lens the KB does not carry: **our components are consumed by CMS component developers**
(Drupal / AEM / Sitecore / SFCC) building larger authorable components. A content author toggles
"dark background" on a *container* — a hero, a promo band. If inverse is a Button property, that
setting must be threaded from the container into every nested button, and then into headings, links,
icons and dividers too — Prism2's mirroring problem re-emerging one tier up, as a variant of every
component rather than a token twin. If inverse is container-scoped context, the author's single
toggle maps to one attribute and every descendant adapts.

So the question is not "is inverse a Button variant" but **"at which tier does inverse live"** — and
the CMS-authoring lens argues for the container. Figma does not force a deviation here: modes set on
an ancestor frame cascade to nested instances, which is the same context mechanism, and is already
the established pattern for dark (#487 §2).

The cost is what makes it a decision rather than a conclusion: the engine emits `on-inverse.*` as
distinct **names**, `CONTRACT_VERSION` went to 1.1.0 *adding* `on-inverse.border`, and collapsing
those into modes would remove ~23 guaranteed paths — a MAJOR contract event plus a deprecation table.

Two things worth feeding back to the KB regardless of which way it goes: the **CMS-authoring lens on
component API design** (the KB's component research assumes an app developer, not a CMS component
developer with a content author downstream), and the observation that **a contextual model needs an
explicit escape hatch for non-token grounds** (imagery, video) — which is what Spectrum's
`staticColor` actually is, and why it is not in conflict with the contextual model.

### `[SKILL]` Only one of five defs is materializable

`button` has an `anatomy` block. `icon-button`, `field-label`, `field-message` and `text-field` do
not — "semantically complete but not materializable", in the schema's own words. Any plan that reads
"apply this to the catalogue" should state which defs it can actually reach.
